###Updating Your Project
1. Commit your changes or remove them from staging
2. Check your remotes by running git remote -v. You should see your origins and the upstreams.

```javascript
origin	https://github.com/vientang/get-momentum.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/vientang/get-momentum.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/chingubelugas/get-momentum.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/chingubelugas/get-momentum.git (push)
```

3. Run git pull --rebase upstream master
4. You now have the latest code! 
5. Do you see merge conflicts? This [Resolving Merge Conflicts][] article is pretty good for explaining what to do.
